#+title: Figure 1


The colour palette used comes from [[https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlGnBu&n=3][colorbrewer2]].

To prepare the data for each visualisation run the corresponding R script.

** Figure 1 \(T_0\) Map

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./output/png/figure-1-t0-map.png]]

=figure-1-t0-map.R= produces a choropleth showing the \(T_0\) across the
globe.

** Figure 1 Cases And Deaths

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./output/png/figure-1-cases-and-deaths.png]]

=figure-1-cases-and-deaths.R= produces the time series of confirmed cases and
deaths along with the LOESS smoothing.

** Figure 1 \(T_0\) and GNI per capita

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./output/png/figure-1-t0-and-gni.png]]

=figure-1-t0-and-gni.R= produces the scatter plot looking at GNI per capita as a
predictor of \(T_0\). The regression is a power law, but on the log-log scale it
appears linear. There is a summary of the model fit in the file
=output/txt/figure-1-t0-and-gni.txt= and the actual figure appears in
=output/png/figure-1-t0-and-gni.png=. The outlier at 25 days is from China.
